    """Ask a person to decide, every time the step reaches this protocol.

    The person is asked through `Host.ask_human`, which is handed the step and shows it with `step.escalations`, so at the end of a `sequential()` the person sees who escalated and why. On its own, `human(stages=["tool_call"])` asks about every call. After a generate, the person sees the whole assistant turn, its text and every tool call it makes, before any of the calls run. When the person ends the prompt without choosing, the host fails closed with a dismissed answer (`HumanAnswer.dismissed`), which this records as `metadata={"dismissed": True}` so later steps can tell it from a person's choice (`HumanDecision.dismissed`). The answer maps to a decision: `approve` to `proceed`, `reject` to `reject` with the person's reason as both the `message` the agent reads and the `explanation`, `terminate` to `terminate` explained by the reason, and `modify` to a `modify` with the person's replacement call.

    The answer is an ordinary decision: it ends a `sequential()` as any link's decision does, and beside other protocols in a `concurrent()` it is one vote, so another protocol's `reject` outranks the person's `approve`.

    Args:
        stages: The stages to ask at, as `SentinelEvent.stage` records them: `"tool_call"` (before a tool call), `"tool_result"` (after it, with the result the model is about to receive) and `"model_output"` (after a generate by the agent's model, before its output reaches the agent).
        choices: What the person may pick, from `approve`, `reject`, `terminate` and `modify`. Defaults to `approve`, `reject` and `terminate` before a call, and `approve` and `terminate` after a call and after a generate, where `reject` and `modify` are not legal.
