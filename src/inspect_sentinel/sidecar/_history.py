    A message counts once, as in Inspect's own process, which tells a message it sent before by what it says and where it is, not by its id. A request carries no message ids in any case: each read gives a message a new one. Where Inspect aligns each input against the one before it, a request here is matched by what each message says, in order, against the earlier request it continues. Requests that open alike share a conversation, such as an agent's, a monitor's call that opens as the agent's does, and another agent given the same task, so the request just before may not be that one. Of the conversation's latest requests, it is the one the request begins as, for the most messages, as a request continues the one before it by adding to its end; then the one that shares most with it, as a compaction keeps the opening and the latest turns; then the latest. A message matched there was sent before; any other is new, even one that says what an earlier message said, as a user may say the same thing twice. A compaction that keeps the latest turns behind a summary leaves them matched, and only the summary is new.
